An app.js file is there where all the wroking of the code is done.In terminal also this file is run
An home.ejs file is made in views folder which is rendered in the models(campground.js file)
In this campground.js file the whole mongoose schema is written 
In the seed folder the two files, the cities and the index.js is present with previous data so that we can work on that data 
In index.js of the seed folder all the connection with the mongoose is done,and the 50 items are added from the data,all the states and 
cities are added.Here also random generation of the images takes place, the location,price,description all the stuff is added as mentioned in the schema 
Also the connection is closed after the work is once done 
In views folder ,in layouts in boilerplate.ejs file all the html is written

instead of the joi we could have used the express validator but the syntax is kind of strange ..
